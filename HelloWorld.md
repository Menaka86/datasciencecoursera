## This is a markdown file

* This is an unordered list
* This is one thing I can do with MarkDown
* I can also make numbered lists

These are some formatting options that can be done with markdown:

1. You can create a list item with a separate paragraph within it <p> like this
2. You can also have several levels of headings:

###This is a tertiary heading, noting that I am using this markdown file to learn its syntax
####There are many more codes which I have not learned yet
######This is the sixth level heading
